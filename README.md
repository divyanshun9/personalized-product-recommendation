# Personalized Product Recommendation
## Overview
This project implements machine learning algorithms to provide personalized product recommendations. It is divided into three main parts:

1. Customer-to-Customer Recommendation<br>
2. Item-to-Item Recommendation<br>
3. Recommendation Based on Location<br>
## Features

1. Customer-to-Customer Recommendation: This feature leverages collaborative filtering techniques to recommend products based on similar customers' preferences.<br>
2. Item-to-Item Recommendation: Utilizes item similarity metrics to suggest related products based on the item currently viewed or purchased.<br>
3. Recommendation Based on Location: Incorporates geographic information to customize recommendations based on a user's location.<br>

## Technologies Used
1. Python<br>
2. Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., sci-kit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)<br>
3. Data Processing Tools (e.g., pandas, NumPy)<br>
